# Scraping-Data-from-HackerNews
This project consists of one python script "scrape.py".
What the script does is:
  1. scraping data from "https://news.ycombinator.com/news" based on the number of pages the user enters
  2. collecting the title, the link and the points of each article
  3. printing articles that have points higher than 99
